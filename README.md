## Data Analysis Project on Customer Segmentation using unsupervised Machine Learning.

This is a Customer Segmentation project on Mall Customers using **Clusterring**, Segmentation is a great tool to identify marketing groups from a larger population 

### Problem Statement for this project 
* **Understand the target customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy**
    - We were given the Data of Mall customers and the employer tasked us to find the group of customers to be focused on for their marketing campaign.
    - Find the most important group based on their income, age, and mall shopping score.

### Approach:
  * **Divide the customer into approachable groups**
      - Create a subset of a market demographic based on the criteria
      - criteria being Income, Age, and Spending.

### Steps:
* **Perform EDA(exploratory data analysis)**
* **Use KMeans Clustering**
* **Use summarize Statistics on the clusters**
* **Visualize**

  * From this finding the target group that needs to focus for the marketing campaign is **Cluster No.2**
    - Because of their high Spending score and Income
 
  * **Cluster No.0** was also added to the focus group because of its 2d best high Spending score
